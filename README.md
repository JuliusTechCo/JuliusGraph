# Hey, Welcome ðŸ‘‹

In this repository you will find guidelines to access [Julius
Technologies](https://www.juliustech.co/) tutorials to learn and test our low-code graph
computing platform.

We are a group of researchers and engineers passionate about graph computing. We believe
that this technology can tackle the most computational challenging problems out there. We
are Julius Technologies.

For any additional queries or suggestions do not hesitate to email us at info@juliustech.co.

## Tutorials

Our tutorials are available in two formats:

- As jupyter notebooks running on a server machine allowing an interactive learning
  experience. Please, refer to
  [this](https://github.com/JuliusTechCo/JuliusGraph#request-developer-access) section for
  further details.

- As HTML pages, allowing a rapid access into the material without the need of any setup.
  Click [here](https://JuliusTechCo.github.io/JuliusGraph/dev/) to access the pre-compiled
  learning material.

### Request Developer Access

Please, follow [this](https://backendgraph.com/user/signup) link. If you are already logged
in with your Google account, you will be prompted with some auto-populated fields:

![Sign up with auto-populated fields.](assets/signup_1.png)

Complete the missing information and hit *Request access*. You can also change your account
if wanted. On the other hand, you will be asked to log into your Google account if you are
not currently logged in:

Once you requested access, you will be prompted to the following page:

![Welcome page with proceed to Lab.](assets/landingpage.png)

That's it! You have registered as a Julius developer and now you can proceed to our Lab
Environment by clicking *Go to Lab Environment*. That was easy!

The following step will ask you to Sign In to our Jupyter Hub server:

![Sign In to jupyter hub.](assets/jupyter_signin.png)

This will be required only once. Clicking *Sign in with Google* is enough. Now you will land
in a Jupyter Hub landing page:

At the left panel you should see a couple of folders and a `README.md` file. Proceed to the
`README.md` to checkout some useful suggestions. Then, the folders contain the following:

- `assets`: holds images for tutorials,
- `data`:  holds data files for tutorials,
- `tutorials`: holds tutorials as jupyter notebooks,
- `persist`: you should locate your work here to make sure it won't be lost if the server is
  restarted.

Ideally, tutorials should be read in order. This is because some tutorials depend on
concepts explained in previous ones.
