# Hey, Welcome ðŸ‘‹

At Julius Technologies we are a group of researchers and engineers passionate about graph
computing. We believe that this technology can tackle the most computational challenging
problems out there.

### Request Developer Access

The following simple steps must be performed to gain access to our development environment
to learn and test Julius' low-code graph computing platform.

Please, follow [this](https://backendgraph.com/user/signup) link. If you are already logged
in with your Google account, you will be prompted with the following auto-populated fields:

![Sign up with auto-populated fields.](assets/singup_1.png)

Complete the missing information and hit *Request access*. You can also change your account
if wanted. On the other hand, you will be asked to log into your Google account if you are
not currently logged in:

Once you requested access, you will be prompted to the following landing page:

![Welcome page with proceed to Lab.](assets/landingpage.png)

That's it! You have registered as a Julius developer and now you can proceed to our Lab
Environment by clicking *Go to Lab Environment*. That was easy!

The following step will ask you to Sign In to our Jupyter Hub server:

![Sign In to jupyter hub.](assets/jupyter_signin.png)

This will be required only once. Clicking *Sign in with Google* is enough. Now you will land
in a Jupyter Hub landing page:

At the left panel you should see a couple of folders and a `README.md` file. Proceed to the
`README.md` to checkout some useful suggestions. Then, the folders contain the following:

- `assets`: holds images for tutorials,
- `data`:  holds data files for tutorials,
- `tutorials`: holds tutorials as jupyter notebooks,
- `persist`: you should locate your work here to make sure it won't be lost if the server is
  restarted.

Ideally, tutorials should be read in order. This is because some tutorials depend on
concepts explained in previous ones.
