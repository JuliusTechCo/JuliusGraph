    "\n",
    "`Atom` is an abstract Julia type. It is the most fundamental building block of Julius Graph\n",
    "Engine and represents atomic operations. The name `Atom` is chosen because they are the\n",
    "minimum unit of distribution and caching in the Julius Graph Engine. Atoms cannot be broken\n",
    "apart further for those purposes. The `Atom` interface enables the Julius Graph Engine to access\n",
    "functionalities implemented in existing software libraries. `Atom`s can be implemented in all\n",
    "major programming languages, such as Python, C/C++, Java, .Net, R and Julia etc. Existing\n",
    "functions written in these languages can be easily wrapped up under the `Atom` interface and\n",
    "used in the Julius Graph.\n",

    "There are several different subtypes of Atoms for different use cases. We first introduce\n",
    "`Datom`, which is the most generic `Atom` type that encapsulates any numerical or data\n",
    "operation. The `Datom` interface only exposes a single method called ```fwddata!```. The\n",
    "```...``` syntax in the function signature is a Julia specific syntax for catching a varying\n",
    "number of arguments. A subtype of `Datom` must override this method to implement its specific\n",
    "data or analytical algorithms.\n",

    "```julia\n",
    "fwddata!(self::Datom, xs...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fwddata!` method can take any number of input data objects in `xs` and **must return a\n",
    "vector** of output objects. The return type of vector is chosen to be explicit that the\n",
    "output could contain multiple objects.\n",
    "\n",

    "configurations to function properly. Runtime configuration is an important aspect of\n",
    "system building, which is the topic of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtime configuration usually includes the following attributes:\n",
    "* Distribution: whether a system is running on a local computer or a distributed computing\n",
    "  environment\n",
    "* Caching: should the intermediate results being cached, and how/where it is cached\n",
    "* Adjoint Algorithmic Differentiation (AAD): whether the system execution includes AAD\n",
    "* Batch or Streaming: whether the system is running once in batch mode, or running in live\n",
    "  mode with continuous streaming data\n",
    "\n",
    "In a traditional development environment, separate and duplicated codebases are created in\n",
    "order to support different runtimes. For example, it is common for a bank to have separate\n",

    "The Julius Graph Engine provides a number of common runtime configurations out of the box.\n",
    "Different runtime environments can be created on-demand from a common set of Rules and Atoms\n",
