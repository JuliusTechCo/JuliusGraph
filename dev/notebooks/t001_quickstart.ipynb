    "  * Some cells print out a url, which you can click on and bring up an interactive web UI to\n",

    "  * In the unlikely event that the notebook becomes irresponsive, you can try \"Restart\n",
    "    Kernel\" from the Kernel menu, then run individual cells one by one using `Shift+Enter`.\n",
    "  * Some tutorials use local clusters consisting of multiple processes to mimic the effects\n",
    "  of graph distribution over a remote clusters. By default, these local clusters\n",
    "  automatically stop after idling for 15min to conserve CPU and memory resources. You will\n",
