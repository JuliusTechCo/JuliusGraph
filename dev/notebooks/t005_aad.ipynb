    "  * Select \"run all cells\" on this notebook from the Run menu in Jupyter notebook or Jupyter\n",
    "    lab. This step will produce intermediate data output and charts.\n",
    "  * Some cells print out a url, which you can click on and bring up an interactive web UI to\n",
    "    visualize the graph data.\n",
    "  * In the unlikely event that the notebook becomes irresponsive, you can try \"Restart\n",
    "    Kernel\" from the Kernel menu, then run individual cells one by one using `Shift+Enter`.\n",
    "  * Some tutorials use local clusters consisting of multiple processes to mimic the effects\n",
    "    of graph distribution over a remote cluster. By default, these local clusters\n",
    "    automatically stop after idling for 15 minutes to conserve CPU and memory resources. You\n",
    "    will need to rerun the entire notebook if your local cluster stopped due to inactivity.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The main topic of this tutorial is adjoint algorithmic differentiation (AAD), it is\n",
    "a powerful technique to compute 1st order derivative quickly and exactly using chain rules.\n",
    "AAD offers a significant performance gain, sometime thousands of times, comparing to the\n",
    "traditional finite difference method (i.e. bump and recalculation) for computing first\n",
    "order derivatives. AAD is particularly relevant for quantitative finance applications, as\n",
    "the 1st order derivatives are widely used for hedging and risk management.\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional approach to implementing AAD requires a tape to record the forward\n",
    "calculations, then the tape is run in reverse for the backward AD. This approach is memory\n",
    "intensive and does not scale well to large applications or systems. A large system\n",
    "consists of many software components running concurently on multiple computers, it is not\n",
    "feasible to record a consistent tape across multiple computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julius offers an easy and efficient way to implement AAD for large distributed systems.\n",
    "Julius use the computational DAG to cache the value and keep track of the dependency of\n",
    "the primal calculations, then the entire DAG is run in reverse for the AAD calculation.\n",
    "Both primal and backward AD run can be fully distributed by Julius Graph Engine for high\n",
    "performance and scalability, all of this is achieved without using the memory\n",
    "intensive tape recordings.\n",
    "\n",
    "AAD is a rich and complex topic, this tutorial is only a very high level introduction\n",
    "to Julius AAD capabilities. Please reach out to us at (info@juliustech.co) for a more\n",
    "in depth demo if you are interested in learning the full capabilities of Julius AAD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the quickstart, we start with a simple Fibonacci sequence as the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantom\n",
    "\n",
    "We have introduced the type `Datom` in the quickstart tutorial. `Quantom` is another\n",
    "important subtype of `Atom`, it stands for quantitative atom. ```Quantum``` is the main\n",
    "work horse for numerical computations with AAD. Unlike Dataom that can take any data\n",
    "types as inputs and output, the inputs and outputs of Quantoms must be vectors or\n",
    "matrices of `Float64` (double precision floating point numbers). Non-numerical datatypes\n",
    "would not make sense for AAD, which is the primary reason to use a `Quantom` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will not go into the details of the `Quantom` interface or\n",
    "how to implement new `Quantom` types. Instead, we will use existing `Quantom` implementations\n",
    "provied in Julius distribution to illustrate the AAD capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julius provides a rich set of `Quantom`  libraries for the most common numerical algorithms,\n",
    "including root searching, interpolation, and common stochastic processes etc. All the\n",
    "Julius `Quantom` implementations come with full AAD support and have been extensively\n",
    "tested."

    "## Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main challenges in AAD implementation is its memory consumption. The reverse AD\n",
    "calculation in AAD requires the primal calculation results to be cached. In the traditional\n",
    "tape based approach, the memory required for caching the primal calculation results\n",
    "can grow beyond the size of available physical memory, causing AAD execution to fail for\n",
    "large problems. Advanced AAD techniques, such as checkpointing, are needed to limit the\n",
    "memory consumption for large problems, but these advanced techniques requires additional\n",
    "coding efforts thus further complicates the AAD implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julius Graph Engine automatically caches all the intermediate results in the computational\n",
    "graph. For very large problems, Julius can automatically distribute the computation graph\n",
    "across multiple computers, and leverage all of their physical memories. Therefore, Julius\n",
    "can access practically an unlimited amount of memory when running in distributed mode,\n",
    "therefore it is no longer subjected to the the physical memory limit of any single computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, Julius only caches the primal results at the node level, as opposed to the\n",
    "individual arithmetic operator level as in the traditional AAD taping implementation.\n",
    "As a result, Julius caching is much more memory efficient for complex problems. Julius\n",
    "effectively implemented automatic checkpointing for every individual `Quantum`.  An\n",
