    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "ML model experiment tracking is a common challenge for data scientists and engineers. We hear\n",
    "the following story too often:\n",
    "\n",
    "”My team spent months training a massive ML model and we got excellent results at some\n",
    "point. But unfortunately we can't reproduce it any more because a number of things have\n",
    "changed, the data, the underlying python library versions and hyperparameters, etc. We are\n",
    "just not sure which combination have worked ...\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This highlights the serious issues around ML experiment tracking. In order to reproduce a\n",
    "past ML run exactly, three things have to be persisted and recovered,\n",
    "1. the runtime environment, including hardware, OS, software libraries etc\n",
    "2. the input data\n",
    "3. the entire code, parameters and configurations, to be able to re-build the entire\n",
    "   data/analytical pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment tracking becomes much more challenging if the model runs on a distributed\n",
    "environment. To guarantee reproducibility, each ML experiment should run from a fresh\n",
    "environment, otherwise the data, setting or environment could change between runs. For\n",
    "example, some data files could be added or modified as part of the runs. However, a complete\n",
    "refresh of a complex distributed data and analytical pipeline is often out of the question,\n",
    "as it consists of many software components, parameters and configurations. This is why most\n",
    "existing experiment tracking solutions only persist the parts of the pipeline that are most\n",
    "relevant for the ML models. The downside of this approach is that the stored ML runs can\n",
    "often fail to recover the exact results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leveraging its distributed graph computing engine, Julius offers an experiment tracking\n",
    "solution that can persist and recover an entire distributed data and analytical pipeline, as\n",
    "well as the full runtime data and environment. Julius is the only solution on the market\n",
    "with such capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julius persists the model experiment with its entire data & analytical pipeline using the\n",
    "following simple steps:\n",
    "1. spin up a fresh virtual distributed environment, which only takes a few seconds\n",
    "2. run the ML experiment and then record the entire session on the Julius server side, and\n",
    "    persist the recorded session onto long term storage. The recorded session contains the\n",
    "    step by step instructions to recreate the entire runtime environment, including the\n",
    "    entire data and distributed pipeline to recover the exact state of the experiment.\n",
    "3. the recorded ML experiment can be easily recovered by replaying it in another fresh\n",
    "    environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we follow a typical workflow of a data scientist to show Julius'\n",
    "experiment tracking capabilities. We use an ML fraud detection model from a previous\n",
    "tutorial as an example. Readers are referred to the \"Distributed Machine Learning pipeline\"\n",
    "tutorial for more details on the model itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Model Development & Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientists usually develop ML models by running experiments interactively in a Jupyter\n",
    "notebook. This section shows the definition and pipeline of a distributed ML model."
